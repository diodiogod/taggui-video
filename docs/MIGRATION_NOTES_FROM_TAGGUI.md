# Migration Notes from Original TagGUI

This page tracks the transition from the original TagGUI baseline to the current TagGUI Video 1M direction.

## Why the Fork Evolved

Initial fork goal:

- add video support

Current scope:

- media visualization and workflow tooling
- large-dataset browsing architecture
- customizable video player skins and multi-view UX

## Migration Themes

- image-only to image+video workflows
- static controls to runtime skin system
- standard list/masonry usage to 1M-scale experimentation
- single-view behavior to spawned/floating multi-view behavior

## Reality Check

- This migration added major capability, but also increased complexity.
- 1M target is not complete yet.
- Legacy and current paths may diverge in behavior during this phase.
